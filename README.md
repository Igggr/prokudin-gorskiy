# prokudin-gorskiy
>Sergey Mikhaylovich Prokudin-Gorsky was a Russian chemist and photographer. He is best known for his pioneering work in color photography of early 20th-century Russia.
The method of color photography used by Prokudin-Gorsky was first suggested by James Clerk Maxwell in 1855 and demonstrated in 1861, but good results were not possible with the photographic materials available at that time. In imitation of the way a normal human eye senses color, the visible spectrum of colors was divided into three channels of information by capturing it in the form of three black-and-white photographs, one taken through a red filter, one through a green filter, and one through a blue filter. `



Original photo consist of the three image (on for each chanel) :  
* blue channel on the top 
* green channel in the middle 
* red channel in the buttom 

To obtain a colorfull image we should split original photo on three part, find right shift and then glow them together.
